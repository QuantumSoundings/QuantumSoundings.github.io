# Week 9
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
This past week has been incredibly busy, but in a good way. My job search has finally been paying dividends. This has been by far the most callbacks I've ever gotten from the career fair. Over the past few weeks I've had interviews with no less than six different companies. I've gone to final round interviews with 2 of them already. This week I went down to San Antonio on Monday and Tuesday to have the final round of interviews with USAA. It was a fun time but it had a... unique structure to the interviews. Two interviewers and two candidates together. We first had to solve sudoku together, then we all got new partners and had to pitch some kind of innovation regarding social media. Finally the pulled us out for traditional one on one interviews. I think I did well but I cant count my chickens before they hatch you know. Then I had a rather busy day on Thursday. Our group managed to get all of our stuff for project 2 done about 30 minutes before 10pm. Earlier in the day I had an on campus with Lithium. I know to people that work there so I had a bit of insider knowledge. I think that one went well too but only time can tell.

### What's in my way?
Right now I'm on cloud nine. Everything is going my way. Just got to not fall behind and keep marching onward!

### What will I do next week?
Next week will be fun. I've got my last scheduled final interview, this time with National Instruments. I've heard good things so I just got to go in there and show them my best!

### What's my experience of the class?
Still good. Nothing new. Keep up the good work professor.

### What's my pick of the week?
If you have a ps4 and loved dark souls you should really check out the game Monster Hunter World. Its a fantastic action game that has devoured more than a few of my leisure hours. Its actually the latest in a long running series that started all the way on the play station 2. The game is more accessible than ever to beginners and you're sure to find a ton of fun in it. 10/10 IGN would recommend.
