# Week 2
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
Honestly what did I do this past week. Nothing too interesting. I'm just getting myself ramped up into the semester. I've put a little bit of working into getting my Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator running on Android. So far I have video output working but no sound or controls. Also its running at around 3 fps. So it needs some improvement haha. Expect more updates on that front throughout the semester!

### What's in my way?
The only thing that's in my way is myself. I always procrastinate. If I can just get that taken care of I would be on top of the world. Aside from myself, I've been having a lot of trouble with android studio. I randomly decides that I doesn't want to load perfectly good plugins, forcing everything to grind to a halt. Projects fail to open and I can't run anything. Definitely not a fun thing. IDE's are great when nothing goes wrong but they can be a royal pain if even the slightest setting gets out of wack.

### What will I do next week?
Probably just going to be finishing up some homework and going to classes. I still have to finish up project one. But that should take very long considering I just have to port it from the c++ version that I wrote for OOP last semester. I'll probably take care of it on Tuesday.

### What's my experience of the class?
These first couple classes have been ungodly boring. Considering that I was in OOP last semester I can barely keep myself awake while we rehash the exact same things. Hopefully it will improve soon. Not to sound overly critical but I didn't think the blog could get any worse from OOP, but I guess I was wrong! Not only are the word count requirements 100 higher but I need to read other people blogs! I don't actually have a problem with participating with other peoples blogs, but it is kind of a pain to invest even more time in this.

### What's my tip of the week?
In case you didn't know, the full text of every single textbook for this class can be found on the websites of various universities in pdf form! Saved me a lot of money.
