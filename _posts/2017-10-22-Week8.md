 # Week 8
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
This past week was not overly fun. I didn't get to work on my emulator at all. I spent most of my time studying for a couple of tests and  and applying for jobs. I think I was able to do well enough on the exams. I also am happy that I made it past the automated screen on so of the job applications. Now I get to do coding challenges...yay. This was also the fastest I've been able to do an OOP project. I managed to start from scratch and finish it in just 3 hours. It was a fun enough way to spend a lazy afternoon. Now I've just got to pretty it up, add the documentation, add more test cases and such, and then its done.

### What's in my way?
Things have been going smoothly so far. I just have to stay ahead of the curve. Well, I guess there is one thing. I am just awful at the in class quizzes. I think I'm sitting at 50% across all the quizzes. Its really frustrating. But I just have to try harder.

### What will I do next week?
My group for virtualization needs to work hard on our project. The due date is still 2 weeks out but its not the kind of project that you can put off. It needs to be worked on right now. I would be legitimately scared if it came down to crunch time with that project.

### What's my experience of the class?
Still positive. That was an enjoyable talk by Goldmann Sachs. Particularly interesting was that data lake thing they mentioned. It seems really useful, but I wonder what kind of performance they can get out of it, and how they actually manage it under the hood.

### What's my pick of the week?
I guess my pick of the week would be reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions. Your one stop shop for all you resume advice, general advice, interview prep, etc, needs. Its a nice community and has been a help to me in the past.
