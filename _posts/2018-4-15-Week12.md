# Week 12
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
This week was a good week. Everything went smoothly regarding school and I'm on pace to finish all my assignments. This week was really dominated by one piece of outstanding news. I got my first job offer today! It's an offer to work on driver software at National Instruments. I really cant express just how relieved I am to finally have an offer. Professor, you make it seem like getting an internship is the single most important thing to landing a job out of college, and honestly I think your right. I feel like if I had internship experience I would have several offers at this point. I have really worried if this would be a massive hurdle to overcome, but I'm glad i made it through and got the offer. I've still waiting on a last few companies to respond to me but it looks likely that I'll take the offer, and if I do I'll definitely be taking your c++ class on the NI campus! OOP was good, but I think I need a lot more c++ experience. 

### What's in my way?
For the first time, I have no major hurdles in my way. Just have to pass all my classes, and that's a pretty low hurdle.

### What will I do next week?
This week I have just a couple assignments that I need to do. As well as writing a large paper for my Music of South Africa class. Honestly I think that paper is going to be the only remotely time consuming thing I will have to take care of in this last month of class. Other than that I think I'm going to need to spend a bit more time working on data mining and data management. I don't want to get caught off guard. I think I'll also spend so time looking at apartments in Austin. 

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience is still positive. 

### What's my pick or tip of the week?
I recently watched a couple of movies and I'd like to go ahead and recommend them. The first is Moana. Its a Disney movie so it shouldn't be new to anyone but if you haven't watched it you're losing out. Its on Netflix so go give it a watch! The second is Coco. That new movie from Pixar. It was a really heartwarming story and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
