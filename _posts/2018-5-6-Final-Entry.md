### What did you like the least about the class?
Honestly I think the part that I liked the least about the class was the weekly blog post. While I understand the intent and reasoning for having them, the always felt like the low point of the week. "sign better not forget the about this weeks blog post." I never looked forward to working on it.

### What did you like the most about the class?
Probably working as a team to get things done.

### What's the most significant thing you learned?
I learned to better work as a team. It is such an immensiely important skill that I'm glad I got the chance to work on it. Aside from that I became really comfortable writing python this semester so that's nice.

### How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?
It really varied week by week, but if I had to take a guess it would be between 2-5 most weeks and up to 10 the week a project was due.

### How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?
Maybe 2 or 3. At least in the beginning. By the end I didn't keep up with the reading at all.

### How many lines of code do you think you wrote?
I think I ended up writing between 1 and 2 thousand lines of code. 

### What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
This was the first semester that I used Slack. Now I don't think I'll be able to live without it.

### What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?
I think we were able to do everything with only the required dev tools.

### If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?
Overall I really like the course and I like Dr. Downings style of teaching. Having taken Object Oriented Program last semester I was really struck by just how similar the opening of both courses are. While the opening concepts of the course are very important I think it would be nice if there was a bit more seperation between the two courses. For example a different first project would be nice.
