# Week 10
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
Compared to the previous week this week has been practically a walk in the park. I spent most of my programming time working on my mobile computing project. Basically its a port of my NES emulator for android. This week I made some great progress. I got a save state selection screen up and running and I was able to get a nice settings menu going. My goal is to be able to put it up on the google play store at the end of this month. The last big thing that happened was that I had an all day set of interviews at National Instruments. Let me tell you, getting up at 6am to get there bright and early at 7:30 is not fun at all. Combined with my splitting headache it was not a fun day. But I kept up the energy. Overall I think that I did well on the interviews but only time will tell. It seems like a really nice place to work. The site was really nice. Other than that I've been sick all weekend. Yay.

### What's in my way?
Nothings in my way! I'm keeping up my momentum and getting stuff done!

### What will I do next week?
This week I have a few things that I need to get done. I have a check in for mobile computing so I'll have to add a little bit of polish to my app. We've also got the next stage of the project due so there is that. Finally I think I've got an assignment due in data mining. I've spent most of my weekend on it so far so it should be really easy to get it finished up.

### What's my experience of the class?
Still good. Keep up the good work professor.

### What's my pick of the week?
I've had a bit of an addiction for the last 8 years. Basically, I love root beer floats. So I'm going to say that is my pick of the week. Get some vanilla ice cream and some a&w root beer put that stuff in a big ol glass get a big straw and a spoon and bam! You got yourself a delicious treat. So yeah next time you want something sweet do yourself a favor and have a root beer float.
