# Week 6
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
This past week has me finally making some progress on securing a job post graduation. I think this past career fair is the most successful one I've ever done. I was able to get 2 on campus interviews within days of the fair and I was also able to get an on site interview. I'm also expecting some more calls in the coming days but you can't count chickens before they hatch. This progress is starting to relieve all the stress I've been building up during the past year. Once I finally do get an offer it will be such a relief. Aside from that I've been reading so interesting light novel series. Its a fun time. I also got to watch NGNL Zero. An excellent movie.

### What's in my way?
Just like always it seems the only thing in my way is my motivating to get things done without procrastinating. But it seems like I've been getting a bit better at that recently. Maybe to success at the career fair is helping to motivate me.

### What will I do next week?
This week I'm just going to be working on projects, going to class and having fun. If all goes well I'll be having an onsite interview on Friday. Other than that I'll just be hoping for more call backs for interviews. I also want to play a bit more of Monster Hunter World. I haven't had much time for games but I'd like to play more since its such a good game.

### What's my experience of the class?
Class is going well. The project is a bunch of fun to work on. Learning a whole lot with this one.

### What's my pick of the week?
So my pick of the week is a bit of software known as Calibre. Its basically a manager for you ebook library. I've been using it quite extensively to edit the metadata of all my various ebooks. It also has a great feature to convert pdfs into epub or mobi files. Which are special file formats that let ebooks be displayed with variable wordcount per page, different font sizes and various other enhancements. It can also sync the books in your library to a mobile device. Its really helped me manage my 140+(and growing) library. A+ software.
