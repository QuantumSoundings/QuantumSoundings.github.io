# Week 4
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
This last week was somewhat interesting. I guess the most important thing is that my team managed to settle on and get our project idea approved. It's nothing too original but it will be useful. Other than that I had some fun with mobile computing. I had to implement a simple mp3 player app. Nothing too special, but it was a fun challenge and definitely the most interesting homework yet. On a non work related note I've been spending a lot of time reading light novels the past few weeks. It really hasn't helped my procrastination in the least, but I am enjoying them so much I cant bring myself to stop reading them.

### What's in my way?
It's always the same. Me, myself and I. I'm having a hard time with this, my lack of getting things done is really starting to piss me off. 

### What will I do next week?
Next week I will be banning myself from most of my leisure activities. Hopefully with this kind of motivation I'll be able to make some real improvements in how I handle things. If things continue on like they are its likely I'll be a burden to my team. I don't want that. So I need to make a real effort to change. 

### What's my experience of the class?
I'm not sure what you want me to say here professor. I don't want to keep rehashing the same thing over and over again. You do a good job teach. A+. The class itself is interesting. No particular complaints or really stand out things.

### What's my tip of the week?
I made pina coladas for the first time by myself this weekend. I have some advice. With this drink its important to have a higher ratio of coconut mix to pineapple juice. Combined with that, vanilla ice cream is a must. The end result is a truly delicious drink. Here is a tentative recipe. For a standard blender fill it 1/3 full of ice. Add 4 large scopes of vanilla ice cream. Add 1/3 of a can of coco lopez. Add maybe a 1/4 cup of pineapple juice. Add some clear rum. Blend the mix. Continue adding rum and blending until the consistency is smooth and thick. Enjoy!
