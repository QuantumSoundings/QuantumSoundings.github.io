 # Week 9
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
This week was rather uneventful. I didn't do much of note. I spent time working with my group for virtualization. We're getting fairly close to being done with our project. So that's nice. This weekend my parents were attending a wedding so I had to travel home to take care of the family pets. So I got to enjoy a peaceful weekend at the very least. I also found out that I'm going to the final round of interviews for one of the companies I applied to. I was a little surprised as it had been almost a month since I had last heard from them. I had written them off but I'm happy none the less. 

### What's in my way?
The only thing that's in my way is myself. I need to maintain focus on my goals and my steps to reach them. I need to avoid complacency and I need to put of things that can wait. Like the bunches of newly released video games that are just begging me to play them. Aside from that I've noticed bits of depression starting to creep up in me. I'm taking steps to resolve it. 

### What will I do next week?
Register for classes! I have to take 4 upper division cs classes next semester so it'll be a tough on. I need to meet with my adviser to get everything sorted out so I can register without any problems. 

### What's my experience of the class?
Still positive. 

### What's my pick of the week?
If I had to pick anything it would probably be google hangouts. I used it this weekend to do some pair programming with my virtualization group. It worked quite well. We could all see the each others screens. Its a great tool.
