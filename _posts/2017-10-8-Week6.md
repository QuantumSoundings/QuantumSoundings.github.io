 # Week 6
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
This past week I continued work on my c++ port of my emulator. I'm pleased to report that not only was I able to get it working but I was able to do something that I had a long standing interest in. For several years now I have followed the Nintedo 3ds homebrew community. I had always thought that I would never be able to contribute to the community but now I have made the first steps to my very own contribution. I was able to compile my emulator for the 3ds! While it doesn't run at full speed I'm still incredibly happy with the result. This really shows me some of the power of c++. Being able to take the same source and compile it for a different platform so easily is really nice! I just have to hook up the audio system in the emulator to the output on the 3ds and I'll have a fully functional prototype!

### What's in my way?
Right now there is nothing in my way with regard to school. I'm getting my work done and my personal projects are coming along nicely! I just have to do some optimizing to get my emulator running smoothly. It will be quite a challenge to preserve emulation accuracy will increasing performance.

### What will I do next week?
This week is all about studying for tests. Everything else is on hold for now.

### What's my experience of the class?
Nothing has really changed about my experience. Still positive. I didn't chicken out when I got called so that's good.

### What's my pick of the week?
My pick has got to be the incredible community and tools around 3ds development specifically libctru and devkitPro. Once I got everything setup it was incredibly easy to get my code running on the 3ds. I have to really thank the community for all the time they but into creating such a simple and powerful 3ds development api.
