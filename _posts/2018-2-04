# Week 3
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
Last week I finished up a couple of projects for different classes. First was an introductory assignment for the data mining course. It was pretty interesting. I learned quite a bit about pyplot and about using juypter notebooks. I think as long as I can follow along with the math in that class its going to be a lot of fun. Next I worked on the collatz project. Since I was in OOP last semester I already had an idea of what I need to do to get it working quickly. On that note, shame on you Professor Downing. Using the same introductory project for both of your classes is kinda silly. At least give something slightly different. Anyway it didn't take too long to get everything sorted out. Last I finished up working on an assignment for mobile computing. Basically a version of battles from risk. It was a fun project but didn't take more than a could of hours. Other than school work I've been enjoy a couple of different Light novel series and play Monster Hunter World. To top it all of my parents took me out for bbq. It was a good week.

### What's in my way?
Same as last week. My biggest problem continues to been myself. I know that if I could just get the motivate to start working I could accomplish great things. I just sadly cant get motivated most of the times without an imminent deadline. Its a sad state of affairs.

### What will I do next week?
Well there are some things I'd like to do but I'm not sure if I'll make it to them. First I'd like to get my emulator running more smoothly on android and maybe get some sound output. I'd also like to meet with all my group members for the project. 

### What's my experience of the class?
I'm not sure what you want me to say here professor. I don't want to keep rehashing the same thing over and over again. You do a good job teach. A+. The class itself is interesting. No particular complaints or really stand out things.

### What's my pick of the week?
I'm going to go with Juypter Notebooks and pyplot. Like I said earlier I got to use them for the first time this week, and I've got to say they are quite something. Once you figure it all out it makes processing the data I was given really easy. 10/10 ign would recommend.
