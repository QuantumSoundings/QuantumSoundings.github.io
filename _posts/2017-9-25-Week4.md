# Week 4
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)


### What did I do this past week?

This past week was fairly productive. After getting all of the input bugs worked out I was able to pass all the HackerRank tests for the 
voting project! All by wednesday. This left me with the lull I was hoping for last week. I took advantage of this to add some new features 
to my NES Emulator. I managed to get my On-Screen display running. This will let me inform the user when events happen, such as pressing 
the key to save a state or change the volume etc. I also finally got around to adding an export feature for the audio. It will record into a
wave file! I also added some new hotkeys for volume and some other functions. This is almost like my baby, so sorry if there is too much talk
about this project.

### What's in my way?

It probably comes down to myself. I got complacent towards the end of the week and started to let some things slip. For instance I missed the due
date of this update. 

### What will I do next week?

I'm planning on hitting HackerRank hard to sharpen up on data structures for (hopefully) upcomming interviews. I need to hit the job search hard.
Its the biggest source of stress in my life and I'd like something secured asap.

### What's my experience of the class?

Class is good. I was actually there on monday 9-25, but I froze up when the professor called on me (twice). I'm really disappointed in myself when
I do something like that.

### What's my pick of the week?

I have no idea. I didn't really look into anything other than what I was working on.
