 # Week 10
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
This week was pretty good. My group for virtualization finished up our big project, which is a great relief. This week I also was able to put some time into my emulator. I got a bug on Friday to try and implement some SOLID principles into my UI components. I think I managed to do it pretty well, but its hard to know if I'm going in the right direction with no feedback. Anyway. I managed to put a good dent into the Darwin project so it should be in maybe another 2 hours or so of work. Progress. 

### What's in my way?
Same old same old. Just have to keep my head in the game and moving towards the finish line.

### What will I do next week?
This is an exciting week. I've got the final round of interviews for on of my companies and a first interview for another. It feels good to be getting responses to all the job applications I've been sending into the void.

### What's my experience of the class?
Still positive. The latest talk by the underarmour people inspired me to take up some SOLID principles in my own projects. Its been rather fun figuring them out.

### What's my pick of the week?
I think I'll go with Intellij by JetBrains. It has been really useful the past couple days. It has built in UML generation and its code analysis has really helped me to clean up my emulator. I really think it's one of the best java ides around. Even if it can be a little unwieldy at times. The UML was particularly useful as one of the main things I was going for the last couple of days was to decrease how much all my different classes were talking to each other. It was just a "everything's public go nuts" sort of situation before, but now it's so much more structured.
