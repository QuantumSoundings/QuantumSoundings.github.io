 # Week 7
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
This is starting to feel more like an update blog for my emulator than anything else, but I guess thats fine. This week I was able to add some optimizations that brought my average maximum frames per second to about 210 on my 2.0ghz laptop. This puts it firmly in the territory of other well known and high accuracy emulators such as Mesen. I also got around to hooking up the audio to SDL, so I can now confirm that audio works as intended! In non-emulator news I spent most of my week studying for tests and taking a break from any heavy coding. Everyone needs a break now and then right?

### What's in my way?
Right now while it does work, my emulator runs quite poorly on my 3ds. Averaging only 10fps. This makes complete sense given that the 3ds's cpu is an ARM dual core clocked at only 268Mhz. This leaves me in quite a bind. I really want to get it working at full speed, but my main point of pride in my emulator is its accuracy. In order to make it faster I think I'm going to have to sacrifice accuracy which I don't really want to do. I may be able to speed it up in some ways, but I don't want to resort to any "hacks". It really is quite the pickle to work out.

### What will I do next week?
More studying and more job applications! 

### What's my experience of the class?
Still positive. I think I would have enjoyed the test format more if I hadn't been somewhat sick. I really wanted to get out of there as fast as possible so I was a little bummed out that the hackerrank portion was locked. But I understand why it was.

### What's my pick of the week?
I guess I'll go with Visual Studio this week. It was honestly not fun at all to get everything setup. I had problem after problem. With that said it is quite a solid and feature rich ide for c++ once you actually know what your doing.
