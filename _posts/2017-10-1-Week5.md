# Week 5
![_config.yml]({{ https://github.com/QuantumSoundings/QuantumSoundings.github.io }}/images/profilepicture.jpg)

### What did I do this past week?
This past week was somewhat interesting. I decided to try my hand at porting my emulator over to C++. Right now I should have the basics ported over. I've spent at least 8 hours doing the basic port so far and it hasn't been very forgiving. I've encountered numerous difficulties that, coming from java, I've never had to deal with. The first of which was some fun circular dependency fun. After a bit of google-fu I was able to workout correct way to handle my classes. Using forward declaration and a split .h/.c++ approach. Now I just wish there was a way to automatically split the files. Right now the emulator is only outputting debugging information. I've spent most of my time trying to setup a dev environment just to get SDL working(on windows). But I have a plan of attack!

### What's in my way?
With regard to the emulator, I think the cpu class needs to have its logic looked at. I'm going from using byte and int in java to now using the proper sizes and unsignedness of the variables. Right now the cpu is behaving incorrectly so hopeful the fix doesn't take too long. Any long story short. Setting up development environments can really suck.

### What will I do next week?
~~I want to have the c++ version output graphics by the end of the week. I have some other things to study for but that's about it.~~ I was actually able to get graphics on the screen! And I fixed the bugs with the CPU this evening. All aboard the hype train!

### What's my experience of the class?
Nothing has really changed about my experience. Still positive.

### What's my pick of the week?
My pick of the week are the various tools that make development of c++ on windows just a bit more practical. MinGW and Cygwin. MinGW is a windows port of gcc and stuff while Cygwin is basically linux through a compatibility layer. The setup can be awful but I think the results can be worth it!
